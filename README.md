# RippleTank
I couldn't find a nice open source ripple tank, so here's one.

This requires FreeGlut/glew.

Compile with "gcc wave.c -o wave -std=c11 -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLEW -I /home/arthurdent/Cpp -O4"
or for 3d, "gcc wave3d.c -o wave3d -std=c11 -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLEW -lGLU -I /home/arthurdent/Cpp -O4"
